"""
AgentTrail - Instrumentation Middleware

Wraps every tool call in an OTel span, tags/propagates taint via span
attributes (baggage-style manual propagation kept simple for hackathon
reliability), runs the policy engine, and mirrors each event to the
Agent Trail live panel via a WebSocket broadcaster.

Design choice: rather than reading spans back OUT of SigNoz for the live
panel (adds a dependency on SigNoz query latency during the demo), we
mirror events to the frontend at EMIT time. SigNoz remains the system of
record for dashboards/alerts; the panel is a live tap on the same stream.
